# Image Uploader
trying to implement the things I learned in Django 
The Code is present in the master branch 

This project is a simple image uploader web application built with Django. Users can upload images to the application, and the uploaded images will be displayed on the home page. The uploaded images can be viewed individually, and users can also delete the uploaded images.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Quinos2003/ImageUploader.git
